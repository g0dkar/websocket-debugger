websocket-debugger
==================

A Little Java project to help debug and develop WebSockets servers. Basically it's a console to communicate directly with an WebSockets Server.

- Usage
If you're on Windows, simply download and double-click "websockets-debugger-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar". It's a runnable JAR file. This may work on Linux / OSX too.

Through a CLI just run <code>java -jar websockets-debugger-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code>.

P.S.: Feel free to rename the long filename (automatically generated by maven, hehe)

- Helping
If you find any bugs or think of any feature you'd like included please contact me! Or you can implement them yourself and send them to the project :)

If you want to help translate the application to your language, translate the strings.properties file in the /src/main/resources directory an name it strings_<language code>.properties (or strings_<language code>_<dialect/country>.properties)
